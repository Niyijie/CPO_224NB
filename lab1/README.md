4. laboratory work number: 7
5. variant description: Dictionary based on hash-map
6. synopsis
    In this laboratory work, we developed a library for a specific data structure and implemented the selected data structure in two ways:
   
        a. as a mutable object (interaction with an object should modify it if applicable)
        b. as an immutable object (interaction with an object cannot change it).
7. contribution summary for each member
    Ni Yijie : Dict_mutable
    Sun Qing : Dict_immutable
8. work demonstration
    8.1 we use pycharm to write code and test it
    8.2 we use github to control our code version
    8.3 we can run it in terminal like 
        ` python Dict_mutable_test.py  `
        ` python Dict_immutable_test.py`
   
9. Conclusion: We understand the differences between mutable and immutable implementation
, also know some implementation restriction. Finally, Find possible implementation errors, 
   which can pass some property-based tests.
